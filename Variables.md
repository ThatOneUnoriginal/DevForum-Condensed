## UseCustLogo
This changes the Developer Forum Logo and Icon to a Custom "DevForum _condensed_" version. Default is "1" (enabled) and can be disabled by turning off the variable (or "0")<br>

## ThemeType
This changes _just_ the colour of the Custom "DevForum _condensed_" logo, the rest of the website will continue to use the same colours as the default unmodified website (exception w/ ``UnUglify`` if enabled.) Default is Light though can be switched to whichever one you want depending on the them usage of preference. This variable will be ignored if you're using the default Devforum Logo/Icon.<br>

## UnUglify
This slightly modified some of the default colours that make the Dark (__not__ Roblox Dark) theme better. Changing the Redish Oranges to Blues (matching things like the link colours)<br>

## OpenDyslexic
This changes the default style font from [Public Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Public+Sans) to [OpenDyslexic](https://opendyslexic.org). OpenDyslexic is a free typeface/font designed to mitigate some of the common reading errors caused by dyslexia.<br>
Note: While switching font to OpenDyslexic is an option, I wouldn't recommend using this theme if you have dyslexia or other impairments that may make it more difficult to read/see. This stylus removes the spacing between multiple parts of the website, which may make it harder for such people to as easily use the website.<br>

## FooterType
This changes the Footer Section at the bottom of the page. Default option changes nothing; RemoveSuggested removes the Suggested Topics section when viewing topics; RemoveExternalLinks remove the Roblox Footer Section with External Links to places like Roblox's social channels; RemoveBoth removes both of these.<br>
