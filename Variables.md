## UseCustLogo
This changes the Developer Forum Logo and Icon to a Custom "DevForum _condensed_" version. Default is "1" (enabled) and can be disabled by turning off the variable (or "0")

## ThemeType
This changes _just_ the colour of the Custom "DevForum _condensed_" logo, the rest of the website will continue to use the same colours as the default unmodified website (exception w/ ``UnUglify`` if enabled.) Default is Light though can be switched to whichever one you want depending on the them usage of preference. This variable will be ignored if you're using the default Devforum Logo/Icon.

## UnUglify
This slightly modified some of the default colours that make the Dark (__not__ Roblox Dark) theme better. Changing the Redish Oranges to Blues (matching things like the link colours)
