<b><p align="center">A modification to the Roblox DevForum theme that allows more information to be seen on the screen at once.</p></b>
# About
DevForum Condensed is a User Style/Theme that modifies certain aspects of the Roblox DevForums website. Instead of being constricted to a section in the middle, topics and posts strech across the entire screen. Padding and margins are additionally removed from multiple elements, brining everything closer and allowing more content to be shown on the screen at once.

Note: While switching font to OpenDyslexic is an option, I wouldn't recommend using this theme if you have dyslexia or other impairments that may make it more difficult to read/see. This stylus removes the spacing between multiple parts of the website, which may make it harder for such people to as easily use the website.

# Known Issues üöß
* The ``Swap Font to OpenDyslexic`` and ``Make Dark Theme Less Ugly`` options don't work on ``Roblox Dark`` Theme Mode
* Replies on Topic Posts look <i>Very</i> Messy
  
Additionally, since I'm only ``Member`` on the Developer Forums, I cannot access the category ``Lounge`` so I cannot guarantee that modifications will in-full appear there.
