<b><p align="center">A modification to the Roblox DevForum theme that allows more information to be seen on the screen at once.</p></b>
# About
DevForum Condensed is a User Style/Theme that modifies certain aspects of the Roblox DevForums website. Instead of being constricted to a section in the middle, topics and posts strech across the entire screen. Padding and margins are additionally removed from multiple elements, brining everything closer and allowing more content to be shown on the screen at once.

# Varibales
This theme features multiple variants which the user can modify. Below is a list of all the variables, the available options, and what they change.
| Variable Name | Variable Types| Modifies |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| UseCustLogo   | 1<br>0        | 1: Uses the Custom "DevForum Condensed" logo<br>0: Uses the Default Logo|
| ThemeType     | Light<br>LightAlt<br>Dark<br>DarkAlt<br>GreyAmber<by>RobloxDark| Changes the Custom "DevForum Condensed" Logo Colour (to better fit theme choice and preference.) Will be ignored if UseCustLogo is 0|
| UnUglify | 1<br>0 | 1: Slightly Modifies the Dark Theme, Changing the Orangish Red Buttons/Highlights to Blue<br>0: Uses the default Colours for Dark Theme| 
| OpenDyslexic | 1<br>0 | 1: Changes the font from [Public Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Public+Sans) to [OpenDyslexic](https://opendyslexic.org)<br>0: Keeps the font to the default [Public Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Public+Sans)|

Note: While switching font to OpenDyslexic is an option, I wouldn't recommend using this theme if you have dyslexia or other impairments that may make it more difficult to read/see. This stylus removes the spacing between multiple parts of the website, which may make it harder for such people to as easily use the website.

# Known Issues ðŸš§
* The ``Swap Font to OpenDyslexic`` and ``Make Dark Theme Less Ugly`` options don't work on ``Roblox Dark`` Theme Mode
