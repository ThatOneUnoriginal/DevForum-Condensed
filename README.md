# About
DevForum Condensed is a User Style/Theme that modifies certain aspects of the Roblox DevForums website. Instead of being constricted to a section in the middle, topics and posts strech across the entire screen. Padding and margins are additionally removed from multiple elements, brining everything closer and allowing more content to be shown on the screen at once.

# Note
The theme includes colour modifications that only work on light them, though you can change this by removing the following from ``:root``
<br>``--header_background:<br> #fafbff;``<br>``--secondary:#f3f4f9;``<br>``--tertiary: #2066b6;``<br>``--quaternary: #1d5da6 !important;``<br>``--tertiary-med-or-tertiary: #2066b6;``<br>``--love: #ca2018;``

and remove ``--background-color`` from ``body`` 

The theme also changes ``--heading-font-family`` and ``-font-family`` from Arial (for headings) and Arial (for everything else) to [Public Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Public+Sans). These modifications are also in :root and can be removed the same way.
